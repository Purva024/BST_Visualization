<h1>Binary Search Tree Visualization</h1>
This project presents a visual, interactive page developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for understanding Binary Search Trees (BST) — one of the core data structures in DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms).
<br><br>
<b>Why BSTs Are Important?</b>

BSTs are one of the most foundational data structures in computer science because they:
- Store data in sorted order
- Allow fast lookup without scanning everything
- Model realistic hierarchical problems (like organizational trees or indexes)
- They are heavily used in databases, compilers, search engines, file systems and maps/dictionaries

This project is ideal for:
- Students learning DSA and recursion
- Interview preparation
- Teachers explaining tree operations
- Visual learners
- Anyone exploring algorithm concepts

<b>The page includes:</b>

- A pre-existing binary search tree

- Traversals (level-order, pre-order, in-order, post-order)
